#### Clustering Exercise 1
Dataset: Cereal - Calories csv file.  
Objective: Try out data preprocessing and 2 clustering approaches: k-means and hiarchial clustering.  

#### Clustering Exercise 2
Dataset: Cereal - Calories csv file.  
Objective:  
Try ou with the following clustering. Group homework. k-means, hiarchial, Fuzzy, SOM have to be tried.  
Ideas:  
* Evaluate clusters using SSE
* in slides it is mentiond that k-means is specially affected by outliers so it is better to eliminate outliers in the preprocessing step.
I can add it in Exercise 1 and 2.
* Cluster validity testing is important (Silhouette)
* It was [recommended](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Euwc9fWBJw) to normalize the dataset for SOM. Have to check book inorder to be sure.
