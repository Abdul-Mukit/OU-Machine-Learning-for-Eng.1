#### Clustering Exercise 2
Dataset: Cereal - Calories csv file.  
Objective:  
Try ou with the following clustering. Group homework. k-means, hiarchial, Fuzzy, SOM have to be tried.  
Ideas:  
* Evaluate clusters using SSE
* in slides it is mentiond that k-means is specially affected by outliers so it is better to eliminate outliers in the preprocessing step.
I can add it in Exercise 1 and 2.
